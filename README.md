# WildDex

A wildlife encounter tracking application that gamifies conservation data collection, created at Calgary Hacks 2025.

## Overview

WildDex transforms wildlife encounters into memorable experiences while contributing to conservation efforts. Inspired by Pok√©mon, users can "capture" wildlife sightings using their smartphone, creating their personal wildlife index while helping researchers track animal habits and patterns.

## Features

- Image-based wildlife identification using machine learning
- Geolocation tracking for wildlife encounters
- Community feed for sharing discoveries
- Achievement system with special badges
- Secure user authentication
- Interactive map integration

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop
- Node.js
- npm

### Setup

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suxxmjz/calgary-hacks-2025
```

2. Install dependencies in both client and server directories

```bash
cd client && npm install

## Technical Implementation

### Machine Learning Model

Our image classification system uses TensorFlow to identify wildlife species. The model has been fine-tuned to handle various wildlife categories, focusing on accuracy and real-world application.

### Data Storage

- PostgreSQL database for application data
- Supabase bucket for image storage and retrieval
- Secure user data management through Clerk

### Location Services

Integrated Google Maps API enables precise geo-tagging of wildlife encounters, contributing to valuable location-based data for conservation research.

## Challenges Overcome

- Developed sophisticated image classification models capable of identifying multiple species
- Successfully deployed machine learning models in a production environment
- Integrated complex systems including authentication, storage, and mapping services

## Future Development

- Research portal for authorized users to access wildlife sighting data
- Enhanced classification capabilities for more species
- Extended geographical coverage
- Advanced analytics for conservation researchers

## Team Achievements

- Created an intuitive and user-friendly interface
- Successfully integrated multiple complex technologies
- Developed a practical solution for wildlife conservation data collection
- Implemented secure and scalable architecture
